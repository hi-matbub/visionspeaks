## Delivery and Shipping

#### Delivery Fees

Delivery fees and times vary for different products and are calculated based on the size and weight of your order and its destination. The delivery price for each order will be displayed during the checkout process, prior to payment and order confirmation and included in the total price of your order.

#### Delivery time

Typically, delivery occurs within 10 working days of us receiving your payment authorisation and cleared funds. In some cases the estimated delivery time frame will be longer, for example where items are made to order. From time to time the delivery of specific items will exceed our usual 10 working day  delivery window for reasons outside our control. We work hard to process all orders as quickly as possible and we will send you an email to let you know when your item has been dispatched by us
